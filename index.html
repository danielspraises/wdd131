                <p>
                    My name is Eden PraiseGod Daniel, though most people simply call me Daniel. I was born and raised in Nigeria, West Africa, a country rich in culture, diversity, and history. Growing up in Nigeria has shaped my worldview and given me a deep appreciation for resilience, creativity, and community.
                    At the moment, I am not employed, as I am dedicating my time fully to my studies. However, I am actively seeking remote internship opportunities in software development where I can apply my skills, gain practical experience, and contribute to meaningful projects. I believe internships are a powerful way to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application, and I am eager to take on challenges that will help me grow both personally and professionally.
                    I am currently a student at BYU-Pathway Worldwide, pursuing a degree in Software Development. This program has been an incredible opportunity for me to strengthen my knowledge in programming, problem-solving, and modern web technologies. My passion for technology and coding began at a young age, and over time, it has evolved into a clear career path. I enjoy exploring how software can solve problems, improve lives, and create innovative solutions for everyday challenges.
